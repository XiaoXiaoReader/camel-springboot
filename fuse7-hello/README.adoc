## Simple HelloWorld REST api using Fuse7.1 BOM
The projects build executable Spring Boot fat jar and also can be run in OpenShift.

### Build and run locally 
The Red Hat maven repos are configured in ../configuration/settings.xml Maven settings file. If you don't want to add the same repositories to your maven ~/.m2/settings.xml make sure to execute all the "mvn" commands below by adding:

 mvn -s configuration/settings.xml [COMMANDS]

Run locally:

  mvn clean install
  java -jar target/fuse7-hello-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

Or with spring-boot-maven-plugin:

  mvn spring-boot:run

Try:

  curl -k http://localhost:8080/api/hello
  curl -k http://localhost:8080/api/hello/MyName

### Build and run using MiniShift (or OpenShift) 
*Deploy* to minishift (run only once):
 
  oc project myproject
  mvn fabric8:deploy -Pfabric8
  curl -k http://fuse7-hello-myproject.192.168.99.100.nip.io/api/hello

*Redeploy* to minishift (update deployment) :
  
  mvn clean install -Pfabric8
  
*Undeploy* from minishift:

  mvn fabric8:undeploy 
  
or delete the deployed resources:

  oc delete all -l=app=fuse7-hello

### Prepare Minishift

Download (min v3.7.0): https://developers.redhat.com/products/cdk/overview/

  minishift config set vm-driver virtualbox
  minishift setup-cdk
  #This creates a ~/.minishift directory. You can always delete that to start from scratch.

Use the [latest](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/release_notes/ocp_3_11_release_notes.html) 3.11.x OpenShift version. Run _minishift delete_ to remove the VM and start with different parameters next time.

  minishift start --memory 4GB --openshift-version 3.11.69

  oc login -u system:admin
  #Use admin/admin or developer/developer on console

Add your Red Hat Devloper credentials for Fuse7 builder to enable download from registry.redhat.io.
 
  oc login -u system:admin
  oc project myproject
  oc create secret docker-registry imagestreamsecret --docker-username=me@mycompany.com --docker-password=xxx --docker-server=registry.redhat.io
  oc secrets link builder imagestreamsecret
  
You can verify that secret was added as Mountable secret:

  $ oc describe sa builder
  Name:                builder
  Namespace:           myproject
  Labels:              <none>
  Annotations:         <none>
  Image pull secrets:  builder-dockercfg-jrpl4
  Mountable secrets:   builder-token-f2srd
                       builder-dockercfg-jrpl4
                       imagestreamsecret
  Tokens:              builder-token-68dkx
                       builder-token-f2srd 
  Events:              <none>
  
Now the fabric8-maven-plugin should be abble to deploy the Fuse7 app in the _myproject_ namespace.
